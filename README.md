The detection of RNA-Seq outliers can provide much information in the identification of rare genetic diseases. However, using common methods like calculating z-scores fails to detect all outliers due to the existence of confounders. However, there are not many methods specifically designed for this problem. In a very recently published study, Salkovic et al proposed a method named OutSingle to detect the outliers in the RNA-Seq data. In this method, SVD decomposition and optimal hard threshold were applied to gene-specific z-scores based on the log-transformation of the gene count data. The denoised z-score matrix will then be used to calculate the outlier score. In our project, we followed their algorithm and wrote the OutSingle method into an R package, which currently only has the Python script. We also tested the calculation speed with the original method developed in Python and compared it to another existing method for outlier detection. We find that this algorithm has a good performance in outlier detection in our dataset. Furthermore, it also works very efficiently. We also discussed some limitations of this algorithm based on our implementation. he full description can be seen in the ReadMe.pdf file.
